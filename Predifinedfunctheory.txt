Predefined functions in C++, also known as built-in functions or standard library functions, are functions that are already provided by the C++ programming language itself or by standard libraries.
Predefined functions are ready to use and can be directly incorporated into your C++ programs without needing to create their definitions.

Here are some common categories of predefined functions in C++.

Input/Output Functions:
You would have to include iostream package to use these functions cout: Used to print formatted output to the console.
cin: Used to read formatted input from the console.
setprecision : Used to set the ios library floating point precision based on the precision specified as the parameter to this method.

Mathematical Functions:
You would have to include cmath package to use these functions sqrt(): Calculates the square root of a number.
abs(): Calculates the absolute value of a number.
pow(): Calculates the power of a number.
ceil(), floor(): Round a number to the nearest integer.

Memory operators:
new : Allocate memory dynamically.
delete : Deallocate memory.

Time Functions:
time(): Get the current time.
ctime(): Convert time to a string.
difftime(): Calculate the difference between two times.

File Handling Functions:
fopen(), fclose(): Open and close files.
fread(), fwrite(): Read and write data from/to files.

Dont worry about all these functions - you will learn about them at a later point in the course.
For now - let's focus on mathematical functions.
